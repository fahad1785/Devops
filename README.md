Python for Devops -
Python can be used for various scrripting requirements in Devops.
Although scripting can be done with shell scripting but shell scripting is limited to shell environments or linux servers/machines only, while python scripts can be used for
both linux and windows machines.

Why Python ?
Because python have better modules as compareed to shell scripting modules and can be used for complex scripting requirements
for ex, API interactions and cli interactions or to handle/manage huge data sets.

like if we have to find any issues geneated while developer pushed the code, inorder to find the author that did the issue, we can write a script
when we run that sscript it gives huge json file from where it becomes very tuff to find out the required data. 
Here comes the different modules available in python for solving these complex issues with ease.


Conclusion 
While both the linux and python scripts can make our work easier it is good to use linux scripts for basic scripting and management of the files and directories
and the python scripts can help us with its modules with more ease to perform and use complex scripts

Important notes
We can do these basic tasks with the help of ANSIBLE as well, which is also an option.
Ansible is developed in Python language,  and it uses YAML language as the scripting language.
So it is essential to learn basics of python for our Devops Requiremen.
